An app I would like to build would be a cooking app primarily focused on west african dishes. I would make the UI fun and card-like so it would be easy to use to recplicate recepies. I would also add videos to recepies upon clicking the card for better how-to. I would additionally add a comment section under each recepie and a review system for better feedback, and place the higher ratings higher on the feed. 

## Notes

N/A

Challenges I encountered consisted of connecting the button to logic using swift
